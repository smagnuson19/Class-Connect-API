Ancient Egyptian civilization is an endlessly fascinating field for intellectual inquiry and debate, the subject of spectacular museum displays, as well as a source of inspiration for various reenactments in literature and film. The modern attraction for Egypt has its origins in Napoleon\u2019s invasion of the country in 1798, and later, and more profoundly, in the 1922 discovery of the tomb of king Tutankhamen in the Valley of the Kings. However, already in the ancient world, the Greeks and Romans expressed fascination for the monuments and the civilization of Egypt, primarily as they experienced its material culture through travel and other cultural exchanges. In this course we will study key works of art and architecture in ancient Egypt as well as explore some important instances in the subsequent reception of Egyptian monuments, history, and mythology."

The course is organized chronologically around a series of themes that foreground the intersection between class, race, gender, and nation-building. Students will learn how to identify and analyze the key genres and styles of 19th century American art, including portraiture, photography, ledger drawing, monuments, and landscape, history, and genre painting. They will consider how character and class are constructed through the portrait; how the claims of settler nationalism are naturalized through landscape; how anxieties about racial emancipation, immigration, and gender advancement are managed through images of the \u201cpeople;\u201d how war both consolidated and radically challenged prevailing conceptions of American identity; and how minoritized populations challenged the dominant construction of \u201cAmerica\u201d throughout this period. There are no pre-requisites for this course. It has been designed as an introduction to the field of American art history as well as to the discipline of Art History more generally. First year students and non-majors are welcome."

With humor, sarcasm, and often biting criticism, satire goes beyond pure comedy to speak with a moral voice. The targets of satire range from the world of fashion and the everyday to that of politics and high culture. We will examine case studies of satirical production, from the 18th century through the late 20th century, from the darkly comic prints of Hogarth and Daumier, to the overtly humorous and/or subversive gestures of Duchamp and Dada, Warhol and Pop Art, to the satire of gender roles and modern capitalism in Postmodernism. We will pay particular attention to the role of satire in modern art as it employed irony, parody, ridicule and exaggeration to attack social mores, political figures and the art world status quo. We will also explore the use of satire in film and TV, from the darkly comic (Charlie Chaplin) to the ridiculous (Stephen Colbert). This course hopes to come to terms with the broad range and appeal of satire in the visual arts."

While many scientific problems involve calculus, two other areas of mathematics are equally (if not more) important: linear algebra and probability. For example, linear algebra is fundamental to stoichiometry and the conservation of matter in chemistry, hydrology and atmospheric dynamics in earth sciences, and cell growth and population dynamics in biology. Moreover, most features of the natural world are probabilistic and frequently best described by probability models, such as the firing of neurons in the brain or the timing of earthquakes. Both are also central to all problems in statistics. This course will explore the application of linear algebra and probability to problems across the sciences. We will cover the basics of solving linear algebra and probability problems as well as formulating simple models to describe and analyze natural phenomena from across the sciences."

If natural selection favors individuals that selfishly maximize their own reproductive success, then why should organisms cooperate at all? Yet evidence for cooperation is ubiquitous in many social animals, from insects to humans. This course will explore how and why cooperation evolves, with the goal of understanding general ecological and evolutionary principles, especially the conditions under which social organisms work together to help one another despite competition and conflicting interests. A central theme of the course will be cases of cooperation in which social animals architecturally construct their surroundings, by building long-lasting shelters."

We will consider how proximate and ultimate causality structure behavior throughout the animal kingdom.

In this course, we will use epithelial tissues as an example to explore these fundamental questions. Epithelia are among the most common types of tissue organization in animals. They line the cavities, ducts and surfaces of all the major organ systems and provide a variety of functions such as secretion, protection and sensing. During development, epithelial tissues also function in morphogenetic processes that guide the formation of body patterns. Defects in epithelial growth control and function play a major role in human diseases such as cystic fibrosis and cancer. The goal of this course is to understand the form, dynamics and function of epithelial tissues, and how dysregulation of epithelia can lead to various human diseases."

Diseases as varied as dementia, various cancers, sickle cell anemia and cystic fibrosis result from past genetic changes in humans that may have actually been favored in some contexts. Moreover, humans and their pathogens continually change in response to one another. In this course, we will place various human diseases in these broader contexts to explore their sources and ultimate causes, and we will consider the implications of this exploration for how science can shape better public policy to produce better health outcomes for individual patients and the public health system more broadly."

May be taken in partial fulfillment of the major in Art History. "

While we treat them as distinct phenomena, the overlap between the two is immense, structurally, neurologically, and culturally. Such connections have long been recognized, but recent research from diverse fields like linguistics, (ethno)musicology, cognitive psychology, anthropology, and neuroscience continues to reveal just how intertwined the two faculties are. Drawing on this body of research and our respective specialties, we explore the language-music connection from the basic ingredients (pitch, timbre, rhythm, syntax), to cultural expression, to evolution and origins. Running through the course is a hands-on case study of a West African xylophone tradition where language and music are so intimately related that they cannot be separated. Students will be taught by a master of the tradition, Mamadou Diabat\u00e9, to feel for themselves what it means to speak through an instrument."

We will read texts written in English or translated from French, Portuguese, Arabic and African languages. Through novels, short stories, poetry, and drama, we will explore such topics as the colonial encounter, the conflict between tradition and modernity, the negotiation of African identities, post-independence disillusion, gender issues, apartheid and post-apartheid. In discussing this variety of literatures from a comparative context, we will assess the similarities and the differences apparent in the cultures and historical contexts from which they emerge. Readings include Chinua Achebe's Things Fall Apart, Naguib Mahfouz's Midaq Alley, Calixthe Beyala's The Sun Hath Looked Upon Me, Camara Laye's The African Child, and Luandino Vieira's Luanda."

This course will examine what's in this toolkit: symmetric ciphers, public-key cryptography, hash functions, pseudorandomness.  To enable the well-cultured computer scientist to understand how these tools are used in the real world, this course will cover these topics from multiple perspectives: theoretical foundations, use in practical computing, implementation and management challenges, weaknesses and attacks, censorship circumvention, public policy questions, and prospects for the future."

Two basic modes of rendering studied are (1) fast, interactive, real-time rendering, where realism is sacrificed for speed or (2) photo-realistic rendering, where the primary goal is a realistic image. Topics include two- and three-dimensional primitives, geometrical transformations (e.g., three-dimensional rotations, perspective and parallel projections), curves and surfaces, light, visual perception, visible surface determination, illumination and shading, and ray tracing. Assignments typically consist of a mixture of written work and \"hands-on\" projects. Knowledge of basic linear algebra is assumed."

It is therefore imperative that Earth Sciences majors planning to be enrolled in this program register in the Off-Campus Programs Office (44 N. College Street, Hinman 6102) no later than February 1 of the sophomore year. All prerequisites for EARS 40 must be met by the end of spring term of the sophomore year; failure to complete prerequisites may cause a student to be denied permission to participate in the Off Campus Program. Enrollment may be limited. Preference given to Earth Science majors."

Economies in the region have been marked by high levels of income inequality and an enormous variety of economic policies, from macroeconomic populism (taken to an extreme in Venezuela) to economic orthodoxy (Chile). This course explores these issues, focusing on why certain economic policies are chosen and the consequences, emphasizing the contrasting experiences of Chile and Argentina. While Chile has achieved economic growth and macroeconomic stability since the mid-1980s, Argentina has struggled to achieve the same outcome and has been beset by financial crises and currency collapses. This course emphasizes the economic policy choices that lead to such divergent outcomes and the political and economic obstacles to economic development, policy reform, and structural adjustment."

This course interweaves economic history with the history of economic thought to explore some of the major economic events that have changed our world over the past two centuries, such as the industrial revolution, the Great Depression, the collapse of socialism, and the globalization of the world economy. We will explore how the ideas of economists continue to influence how we think about how the economy works and the role of government in the economy. In particular, we will be studying the works of Adam Smith, Karl Marx, John Maynard Keynes, Friedrich Hayek, and Milton Friedman."

At the same time, however, the prospect of revolutionary violence made the imagination a dangerous, and intensely debated faculty, as promising as it was potentially pathological, and as likely to produce a Gothic nightmare as a pastoral utopia. This course will examine the richly varied forms of literary and political experience that emerge out of this moment, and that continue to shape modern conceptions of creativity, sexuality, ecology and social transformation. Readings include works by William Blake, William Wordsworth, Percy and Mary Shelley, John Keats, and Thomas de Quincey."

Readings will range widely from Old English poems and epics to Middle English poems, plays, and romances. Our investigation will culminate in two of Chaucer's shorter poems, in which he specifically (and ironically) investigates the nature of sound and its social functions.

The co-evolution of society and the environment involves complex and dynamic interactions whose consequences are hard (or impossible) to predict because causes and effects are often far apart in time and space. This course examines interactions between environmental and social processes from the perspective of sustainability. This course explores: the historical roots of unsustainability and the underlying mental models contributing to this state of affairs; the idea that resilience is the key to a sustainable relationship between society and environment; how institutions and power dynamics influence sustainability; and possible actions to facilitate transitions to sustainability founded on mindfulness of paradigms and ethics."

For each of the problems that are revealed by science, we will also critically evaluate relevant policy solutions to understand how institutional design can (or can\u2019t) enhance human interactions with the oceans. This includes insights into the politics surrounding oceans issues in the US and around the world."

The success of environmental law depends upon balancing the three components of sustainability: ecological, economic, and social/cultural. Today, the primary sources of this balancing act are federal, state, and local ordinances and their myriad regulations. However, these statutes and regulations overlay a common, judge-made, law of property that establishes a system of private and public property, a law of contracts that governs transactions, and a tort law that provides remedies for intentional and unintentional harms. In addition, there is a growing body of international environmental law with both similarities and differences to U.S. environmental law. The major objectives of this course are to survey today's major environmental laws, explore their history, determine how well they balance ecological, economic, and social sustainability and, finally, to discuss how to improve environmental law to better deal with biodiversity loss, human population growth, energy needs, and climate change in the future. Enrollment is limited."

It is also suitable for students with little or no knowledge of the French language, but who have a strong background in another Romance language (i.e. Spanish, Italian, Romanian, Portuguese, Catalan, and also Latin).  French 11 is an accelerated course that combines French 1 and 2 in one term, offering an exciting and fast-paced atmosphere in which to learn French. The course will have a web-based component, which, through cultural, grammar and multimedia learning activities, will complement face-to-face work and prepare students for in-class work. Students will learn to talk about familiar events in the present and the past, as well as formulate plans for the future. Weekly cultural videos will situate in context the grammatical content of the course, making it relevant and meaningful. Students will be actively engaged in a variety of creative written and oral activities that will help them develop their language skills. Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to sign up for French 3 or apply for our French LSAs in Lyon or Toulouse. With the goal of facilitating the acquisition of the target language, this course will be conducted entirely in French."

Emphasis will be placed on France's growing self-awareness as a nation and on the analysis of aesthetic and intellectual issues represented in the major literary movements of this period including romanticism, realism, symbolism, art for art's sake, naturalism, fin de si\u00e8cle decadence, and modernism. Readings may include works by such authors as Chateaubriand, de Sta\u00ebl, Stendhal, Hugo, Musset, Sand, Balzac, Baudelaire, Flaubert, Michelet, Zola, and Huysmans."

This course will examine the formation of these cultural landscapes beginning with those produced by Native Americans, and following the settlement process up to contemporary, post-modern America. Along the way, we will explore, among other things, the development of such American landscape elements as grid-pattern towns, cowboy ranches, skyscrapers, shopping malls, and corporate office parks."

The course will first consider the general theoretical concepts underlying empirical research, including the nature of causality, the structure and content of theories, and the formulation and testing of competing hypotheses. The course will then employ these concepts to develop several quantitative approaches to political analysis. Students will be introduced to two statistical methods frequently used by political scientists, contingency tables and linear regression. By learning to systematically analyze political data, students will gain the ability to better conduct and evaluate empirical research in both its quantitative and qualitative forms.

We will begin by examining a wide range of relevant issues, including: how gender affects political participation and partisan preferences, how boys and girls are socialized differently into politics, how public opinion regarding domestic and foreign policy sometimes differs for women and men, and how a different gender balance among office holders might be expected to affect representation, policy, and governance. The course will then critically examine various barriers that women may face in the pursuit of elected office in the U.S., and we will also expand our view beyond politics, by analyzing women in non-political leadership positions in order to draw useful comparisons. Finally, the course will examine the role of gender in an international context, comparing gender dynamics in the U.S. with those of other countries in order to better understand the future of women in politics in the U.S. and in the world at large. This course is appropriate for all students, from all majors (there are no prerequisites)."

We then turn to the process of \u201crising\u201d and study how countries achieve economic growth. We examine what is needed for them to sustain growth over time, as opposed to seeing their growth fizzle, as many fast-growing economies have done. We also look at how countries manage the environmental and human consequences of industrialization. We look at how great powers succeed or fail at developing and deploying effective military power. Finally we examine the causes and consequences of decline\u2014why great powers fall, and whether the process of decline is expected to be associated with international instability."

From the aftermath of a pandemic crisis through a period punctuated by religious reformations, civil wars, and revolutionary regicides, Europeans steadily adopted more modern attitudes to property, authority, community, work, family, the body, nature, and supernatural forces."

Viewing Native America as an incredibly complex series of borderlands is a useful interpretive model for better understanding the history of Native peoples. Lectures, readings, and class discussion will focus on elements such as cultural contact, conquest and colonialism, missionization, citizenship, gender, and nation. While exploring these various themes, we will touch on some familiar territory such as frontiers and middle grounds, but we will also question our own personal, and often, region-based expertise in order to unpack a more nuanced view of Indigenous borderlands and their significance."

Some attempt to deal with these changes through a critical reflection on the concepts of democracy and ethics and on how justice can be practiced either within or outside of the geographical and spiritual boundaries of the modern nation state. We shall examine how Jewish self-consciousness and a deep attachment to biblical tradition enables these intellectuals to reconcile ethical imperative with political realities. Particular attention will be paid to topics such as the challenges of Eurocentric Christian humanism and universalism to Jewish assimilation; the promises of totalitarianism, Marxism and messianism; the politics of biblical exegesis; history and Jewish mysticism; Zionism, antiZionism and the ArabIsraeli conflict."

While we treat them as distinct phenomena, the overlap between the two is immense, structurally, neurologically, and culturally. Such connections have long been recognized, but recent research from diverse fields like linguistics, (ethno)musicology, cognitive psychology, anthropology, and neuroscience continues to reveal just how intertwined the two faculties are. Drawing on this body of research and our respective specialties, we explore the language-music connection from the basic ingredients (pitch, timbre, rhythm, syntax), to cultural expression, to evolution and origins. Running through the course is a hands-on case study of a West African xylophone tradition where language and music are so intimately related that they cannot be separated. Students will be taught by a master of the tradition, Mamadou Diabat\u00e9, to feel for themselves what it means to speak through an instrument."

While many scientific problems involve calculus, two other areas of mathematics are equally (if not more) important: linear algebra and probability. For example, linear algebra is fundamental to stoichiometry and the conservation of matter in chemistry, hydrology and atmospheric dynamics in earth sciences, and cell growth and population dynamics in biology. Moreover, most features of the natural world are probabilistic and frequently best described by probability models, such as the firing of neurons in the brain or the timing of earthquakes. Both are also central to all problems in statistics. This course will explore the application of linear algebra and probability to problems across the sciences. We will cover the basics of solving linear algebra and probability problems as well as formulating simple models to describe and analyze natural phenomena from across the sciences."

        "description": "This course is a sequel to MATH 3 and is appropriate for students who have successfully completed an AB calculus curriculum (or the equivalent) in secondary school. Roughly half of the course is devoted to topics in one-variable calculus, selected from techniques of integrations, areas, volumes, numerical integration, sequences and series including Taylor series, ordinary differential equations and techniques of their solution. The second half of the course studies scalar valued functions of several variables. It begins with the study of vector geometry, equations of lines and planes, and space curves (velocity, acceleration, arclength). The balance of the course is devoted to studying differential calculus of functions of several variables. Topics include limits and continuity, partial derivatives, tangent planes and differentials, the Chain Rule, directional derivatives and applications, and optimization problems including the use of Lagrange multipliers."

This class will begin with the regional and global contexts in which Islam emerged, examining the history of the Prophet Muhammad, the Qur\u2019anic revelation, and the first community of believers. We will then look at the expansion of the \u201cabode of Islam\u201d over the course of several centuries, asking why so many people in so many different regions converted to Islam. We will also study philosophical, cultural, legal, political, and social trends in region now known as the Middle East and North Africa until the era of early European colonialism."

One way of examining this complex society is through revisiting Egypt&rsquo;s struggle with modernity. From Mohamad Ali&rsquo;s modernization program in the 19th century to the recent chanting for freedom in Tahrir Square, Egypt&rsquo;s different social forces, state, and international partners have been shaping its modernity in different&mdash;sometimes contradictory&mdash;ways. This struggle transformed the political, economic, social and cultural landscape of the country, and continues to be the focal point of its unfolding drama. The spread of modern ideologies (nationalism, liberalism, socialism), the construction of Islamism, the reordering of social hierarchies and family structure, the transformation of norms and values, among other issues, are better understood when read as part of this long, twisted, and tormented march of modernity."

While we treat them as distinct phenomena, the overlap between the two is immense, structurally, neurologically, and culturally. Such connections have long been recognized, but recent research from diverse fields like linguistics, (ethno)musicology, cognitive psychology, anthropology, and neuroscience continues to reveal just how intertwined the two faculties are. Drawing on this body of research and our respective specialties, we explore the language-music connection from the basic ingredients (pitch, timbre, rhythm, syntax), to cultural expression, to evolution and origins. Running through the course is a hands-on case study of a West African xylophone tradition where language and music are so intimately related that they cannot be separated. Students will be taught by a master of the tradition, Mamadou Diabat\u00e9, to feel for themselves what it means to speak through an instrument."

We will contemplate and engage various elements of Indigenous food systems and health from subsistence food traditions to government commodity foods to urban Native American food movements. Food provides a space where many concepts from Native American Studies converge including food sovereignty, interspecies thinking, land-language linkages, health disparities, Indigenous environmental ethics and Indigenous community resurgence. In this class, we will focus on experiential forms of learning and our time will be organized as weekly field excursions where we learn directly from Indigenous communities, directly from the land, and learn by doing. Nine weeks of hands-on activities will culminate by hosting a fall feast on campus."

Lectures, readings, and class discussion will focus on elements such as cultural contact, conquest and colonialism, missionization, citizenship, gender, and nation. While exploring these various themes, we will touch on some familiar territory such as frontiers and middle grounds, but we will also question our own personal, and often, region-based expertise in order to unpack a more nuanced view of Indigenous borderlands and their significance."

        "description": "Phenomenology offers a distinctive approach to philosophical problems because it is centered on unpacking the structure and content of experience. This course introduces students to phenomenological methods, and then focuses these techniques on the mimetic arts. The arts of imitation \u2013 figurative painting and sculpture, photography, film, theater, and so on \u2013 are particularly phenomenologically interesting. Experiences of them are complex because they involve awareness of the representations as well as what they represent, among other things. As such, they are both excellent candidates for phenomenological analysis, as well as test cases for phenomenological methods. This course will consider both classical and contemporary thinkers in the phenomenological tradition, as well as their critics."

Is it possible to develop a system of categories to identify the highest genera of being and to map the basic structure of reality? Do categories sort extramental entities or concepts or cognitive structures? Are they determined by logic or language? Philosophy is rich with competing attempts to develop categorical systems of reality, cognition, and meaning. This course will examine both historical and contemporary approaches to categories and their importance, including skeptics of the entire undertaking. Authors to be considered may include Plato, Aristotle, Aquinas, Ockham, Su\u00e1rez, Kant, Frege, Husserl, Heidegger, Ryle, Chisholm, Strawson, Dummett, Westerhoff, Lowe, and Brandom."

Quantum mechanics is an incredibly powerful theory; but it is also a deeply troubled theory, and it is far from obvious what it says. In this course we will study quantum theory, its central difficulty (the measurement problem), and options for avoiding the difficulty. We will also evaluate philosophical claims that have been made on the basis of quantum mechanics. No acquaintance with modern physics will be presupposed."

All proposals for Philosophy 87 must be reviewed by the faculty of the Department after having been provisionally approved by the faculty member who is the prospective director. This must be done before the beginning of the term in which the course is to be taken.

As a consequence, the course draws on a variety of disciplines, including biochemistry, biology, physiology, pharmacology, (neuro)anatomy and psychology. The course will begin with in-depth analysis of basic functions of single nerve cells. We will then consider increasingly more complex neural circuits, which by the end of the course will lead to an analysis of the brain mechanisms that underlie complex goal-oriented behavior."

We will then consider human disorders where emotional processing has gone wrong, as this will inform us about how things were supposed to work in the first place. And, then, we will be in a better position to answer the really big questions. What is an emotion? Who has emotions? Do you? Does your neighbor? Do German Shepherds? How do you know?"

Students are awarded one course credit for successful completion of this course once they complete the Neuroscience Honors Program requirements, generally at the end of the spring term. Students register for this course after PSYC 91.01. Students register for only two terms, though honors research coursework extends over three terms. A final grade will replace the \u201cON\u201d for both PSYC 91.01 and this course upon completion of the Neuroscience Honors Program requirements.  See full course description listed with PSYC 91.01 and the Neuroscience Honors program description for more details."

What new answers have been provided to explain our place in the cosmos and reason for being? We explore questions of belief, value, significance, meaning, suffering, love, and justice."

After investigating different ideas of how the world came to exist and various views of the end of time, we will compare different notions of salvation by which various religious cultures tried to assuage fears of the end of the world. With expectations for messianic redemption or visions of power these catastrophic imaginings  and ideas of salvation served as the basis for missionary work and conversion as well as impetus for social and political transformations, rebellions, wars, imperial programs."

What do Western religious and philosophical traditions have to say about such forms of augmentation of life capacities and processes? What promises and perils arise from technological progress? Why is the problem of technology seemingly central to the question of modernity, and how does religion fit in, if at all? We explore a variety of themes, which may include: bodily enhancements, biomedical procedures, humans vs. machines, robotics and AI, as well as digital and virtual worlds, asking what hopes and concerns certain religious and philosophical traditions in the West bring to such developments, and why it matters to think deeply about such issues."

Smith was just one of a cadre of thinkers, many associated with the Scottish Enlightenment, who formulated new ideas of a market society. Smith and these other thinkers often wrote in explicit conversation with theological debates about divine providence and God's management of the cosmos. Religion, it appears, was a major factor motivating such new thought. This class delves into early philosophical, theological, and religious conversations that were central to the new theories of commercial society that became the seedbed of capitalism. We consider thinkers such as Smith, Mandeville, Hume, Hobbes, and Nicole, among others."

By thoroughly studying one of the world's richest oral traditions, Slavic folk life and folklore, we will acquire the tools and techniques necessary for collecting, documenting, and interpreting folklore -- which is perhaps the most truly international of all arts.

        "description": "The world\u2019s population will more than double from 7 to 16 billion by 2100. In addition, some countries\u2019 populations are booming whereas others face rapid decline. What does this mean for public policy, population health and aging, fertility and reproductive health, immigration and social inequality? To gain insight into these questions, social scientists study some of life\u2019s most intimate moments \u2013 sex, illness and death, and moving from home to home. These components of population change (mortality, fertility, and migration) help us better understand the impact of population composition and change. In this class, we will first learn the basic tools that social scientists use to analyze broad population trends. We will then use these tools to gain insight into population patterns across the globe. At the end of the course, students will apply what they learned to the analysis of the population trends of a country of their choice, as well as compare and contrast population trends across different countries."

Sociologists, however, argue that mental illness is socially constructed, and that population mental health is profoundly shaped by social conditions. In this course, we will explore sociological understandings of mental health and illness. We will focus on a range of topics, including: the social construction of mental illness, how social inequality contributes to mental health, and how society responds to the mentally ill."

Since the 2008 financial crisis it became a very popular field of research, highlighting varied and opposed theoretical approaches. The course will focus on critical perspectives to political economy, including a. class conflict, race and ethnic relations and the world system; b. state institutions and their relation to civil society, capital and labor organizations; and c. late developments of the neoliberal economy, the social and economic implications of inequality, and global protests of the 99%."

We will focus on patterns in paid labor force participation and family life in the United States, and discuss the major debates surrounding the causes and consequences of such trends. We will also pay attention to how these patterns look across different races, ethnic groups, and socioeconomic status, as well as briefly examine how these trends compare to other countries. We will conclude by exploring the implication of gender inequality for families, as well as work-family policy debates. "

Understanding how health care is delivered around the world will lead to a better understanding of the relative merits and limitations of various systems. The course is structured as a seminar in which students will be expected to discuss course readings in-depth, as well as develop and present their own research on specific countries of interest."

These cases largely differ from one another, but have in common their opposition to inequality and readiness to struggle against it. The course will focus on the comparison of protest movements and the political processes each case provoked, using theories of social movements and political sociology, and analyzing the economic, social and political context before the protests sparked and the after movements' peaks. We will analyze and discuss in class the Occupy Wall Street movement and the political process it provoked in the US. Each student will chose an international case for comparison, presenting it in class and writing a research paper of their own as a final essay. Students will work in teams of two for their presentations and final research paper."

One key question we will explore concerns whether female politicians are treated differently than male politicians, and how that might affect their strategies for reelection and governance.

These topics will be considered from historical, political, cultural and social perspectives.  In the context of this class, the term \u201cindigenous\u201d is a category that includes tribal nations of the United States including Hawaii, the First Nations of Canada, and the indigenous people of Australia and New Zealand.  The material is presented with particular concern for the diversity of indigenous groups and the variety of their own experiences and autochthony.  We will explore their responses to misconceptions of tribal gender roles and identities projected upon Native people by the agents and institutions of settler colonialism.  This approach opens a broader discussion about the many actions of indigenous communities to deconstruct and decolonize gender categories that are alien to the continuity, integrity, and vitality of their own traditions.  The interdisciplnary approach of this course will engage texts from philosophy, literature, semiotics, history, and policy, as well as gender studies from various socio-cultural perspectives."

Students in this course have the unique opportunity to collaborate with a group of people from behind those social walls from two different perspectives: theoretical and practical. Students study the causes of this invisibility and social isolation (mainly pertaining to incarceration and addiction) by participating in an interdisciplinary arts program with local community members from these invisible populations while at the same time attending discussion-based seminars. This combination of practice and theory asks for students to go beyond a critical reflection on our society by contributing to constructive social actions towards change."
